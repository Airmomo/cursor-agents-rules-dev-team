## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Cursor IDE installed
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of Cursor rules

### Setting

> üí° **IDE Setting HIGHLY Suggested:** For best results with rule generation, update your Cursor settings by adding:
>
> ```json
> "workbench.editorAssociations": {
>   "*.mdc": "default"
> }
> ```

This prevents UI rendering issues with .mdc files in a custom rules form and ensures proper save functionality, and makes it easier to see what the actual rules look like (specifically around hidden FrontMatter).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Airmomo/cursor-agents-rules-dev-team.git
cd cursor-agents-rules-dev-team
```

## üìã Usage

### Creating a New Project with AI Dev.Team Rules

1. **Initialize Project Structure**
```bash
# Clone the Cursor2DevTeam repository
git clone https://github.com/Airmomo/cursor-agents-rules-dev-team.git

# Create your new project directory
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Copy the team rules
cp -r ../cursor-agents-rules-dev-team/.cursor .
```

2. **Configure Project Settings**
- Update project name and details in your new project's README.md
- Customize team rules if needed in `.cursor/rules/`
- Initialize git repository:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize project with AI Dev.Team rules"
```

3. **Start Development**
- Open project in Cursor IDE
- Begin interaction with team by mentioning requirements
- Team agents will automatically coordinate based on rules

### Applying AI Dev.Team Rules to Existing Project

1. **Integrate Team Rules**
```bash
# Navigate to your existing project
cd your-existing-project

# Clone Cursor2DevTeam repository
git clone https://github.com/Airmomo/cursor-agents-rules-dev-team.git temp-dev-team

# Copy team rules (preserving your existing files)
cp -r temp-dev-team/.cursor .

# Clean up
rm -rf temp-dev-team
```

2. **Adapt Existing Structure**
- Review and merge any existing rules in `.cursor/rules/`
- Ensure no conflicts with existing project configuration
- Update team rules if needed for project-specific requirements

3. **Commit Changes**
```bash
git add .cursor
git commit -m "Integrate AI Dev.Team rules"
```

4. **Start Using Team**
- Open project in Cursor IDE
- Team agents will automatically analyze existing codebase
- Begin interaction with team for new features or modifications

### Best Practices for Team Usage

1. **Clear Communication**
- Simply state your requirements or questions directly
- Be specific about what you want to achieve
- Provide necessary context for existing code when relevant
- The AI team will automatically understand and coordinate the response

2. **Project Organization**
- Keep team rules in `.cursor/rules/` updated
- Document any customizations to team behavior
- Maintain consistent project structure

3. **Workflow Integration**
- Let the AI team naturally handle task distribution
- Allow agents to collaborate automatically based on your needs
- Review and approve suggested changes

## üß† Adaptive Learning System

The cursor-agents-rules-dev-team framework features a sophisticated adaptive learning system that continuously improves its capabilities:

### Automatic Rule Generation
- The system can automatically create new rules based on your development patterns
- When you encounter repetitive tasks or workflows, the system can propose creating specialized rules
- Custom rules are created through the rule-generating-agent that formalizes your preferences

### Rule Optimization
- Existing rules are continuously refined based on their effectiveness
- The system analyzes which rules are most helpful and adjusts accordingly
- Rules can be automatically updated to better match your development style

### Context-Aware Learning
- The system recognizes different development contexts and applies appropriate rules
- As your project evolves, the rule system evolves with it
- Domain-specific knowledge is accumulated and incorporated into appropriate rules

### User Interaction
- Simply mention that you'd like to create or modify rules during your workflow
- The system can learn from your corrections and adjustments
- Express preferences about agent behavior, and they'll be incorporated into future interactions
