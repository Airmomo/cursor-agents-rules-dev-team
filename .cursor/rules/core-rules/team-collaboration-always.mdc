# Team Collaboration Guidelines

## Critical Rules

- Team members should proactively identify collaboration opportunities
- Each member should clearly indicate when they need input from others
- Handoffs between team members must include necessary context
- Members should acknowledge and respond to requests from other team members
- All technical decisions should be validated by relevant team members
- Cross-functional concerns should trigger multi-member discussions
- Team members should maintain awareness of project status
- Documentation should be accessible to all team members
- Decisions affecting multiple domains require consensus
- Regular sync-points should be maintained during project execution

## Collaboration Patterns

### Requirements Phase
- Emma leads, but actively consults with:
  - Bob for technical feasibility
  - David for data requirements
  - Alex for implementation complexity
  - Mike for project constraints

### Architecture Phase
- Bob leads, but actively engages with:
  - Emma for requirement clarification
  - David for data architecture
  - Alex for implementation approach
  - Mike for resource alignment

### Implementation Phase
- Alex leads, but regularly connects with:
  - Bob for architectural guidance
  - Emma for requirement validation
  - David for data integration
  - Mike for progress tracking

### Data Integration Phase
- David leads, but collaborates with:
  - Alex for implementation details
  - Bob for architectural alignment
  - Emma for data requirements
  - Mike for timeline coordination

## Examples

<example>
"I see this feature requires both frontend work and data processing.
@Alex, I'll design the data pipeline and provide the API contract.
@Bob, could you review our integration approach?
@Emma, does this align with the user requirements?"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
"I'll just build this part without checking with others"
"That's not my responsibility, someone else handle it"
"Let's make this major change without consulting the team"
</example>
